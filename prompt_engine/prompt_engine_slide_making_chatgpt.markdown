## Slide Making with ChatGPT

<br />

It is already quite common to have AI, such as ChatGPT, to read a long text and output a summary for us. We can actually go a step further to have it output the points we need in making presentation slides.

Below is a short demo where I took a World Bank article and fed that to ChatGPT. You can see how I ask it to produce a few points based on the article and ask it to shorten the points when they are too long.
