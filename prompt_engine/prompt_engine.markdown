# Prompt Engineering

The world has been bombarded by new about AI's new capabilities lately and some have feared they would not be able to catch up and might eventually lose their jobs to the robots.

ChatGPT, New Bing, Microsoft 365 Copilot... I have no doubt that new AI tools will  be integrated into our daily lives very soon. Companies may still need time with the adoption and there may be data or internet policies that they need to overcome.

But as soon as companies allow Copilot and the like to aid their employees, the way people work will be very different when they find some tasks will be much easier with the help from AI.

We can only adjust ourselves to this new trend. Learn to leverage on AI's help if we want to stay productive.

Here I will continue to share new prompt engineering ideas which we can all learn together.
