## ISDA Master Agreement and CSA

<br />

### The ISDA Master Agreement:

- is executed between two counterparties for OTC derivatives transactions, e.g. swaps, forwards, etc
- is commonly used by banks and financial institutions
- reduces documentation burdens, as long confirmations are no more required for all the OTC derivatives transactions
- allows parties to only confirm the material terms of each transaction
- provides standard terms to aid in reducing disputes, improving risk and credit management

<br />

There are 2 main versions of ISDA agreements:

- 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)
- 2002 ISDA Master Agreement

<br />

Crucial sections:

- Section 5 - Events of Default and Termination Events: lists various events, such as bankruptcy, that may lead to the termination of transactions
- Section 6 - Early Termination and Close-out Netting: outlines how transactions will be closed out in an early termination scenario.

<br />

### CSA is for VM

I usually find paragraph 11 to be the meat. You can find these in the CSA:
- What collateral are accepted (eligible credit support (vm)) and haircut (valuation percentage) 
- Base and eligible currency 
- Covered transactions (often exclude spot fx) 
- minimal transfer amount (MTA)
- Delivery amount (round up), return amount (round down), i.e. always over collateralized 
- Threshold
- Notification time (e.g. 4pm each business day)
