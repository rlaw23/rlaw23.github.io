## Introduction

The HKTR (Hong Kong Trade Repository) is a centralised registry. Basically financial institutions need to report their OTC derivatives transactions to HKTR daily.

Many jurisdictions have similar regulatory reporting requirements on derivatives after the 2008 financial crisis.




## What to Report

If a financial institution is in-scope, then it needs to report:

1. its new in-scope transactions daily, by asset classes (i.e. interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, credit and commodities)

2. the daily valuations of each of its reported transactions, also by asset classes



## Reporting Timeframe

Financial institutions need to report its new trades and valuations in 2 days.
