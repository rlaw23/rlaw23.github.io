## ISDA OTC Derivatives Taxonomy

Although OTC derivatives have more or less commonly understood product names, they are not 100% standardized. 

In an effort to standardize this, more or less for the reason of cross-jurisdictional reporting, ISDA has published their taxonomy for Credit, Rates, Equities, Commodities and FX.

For example, a JPY interest rate swap would fall into:

| Asset Class    | Base Product   | Sub-Product   |
|:---------------|:---------------|:--------------|
| Interest Rate  | IR Swap        | Fixed Float   |
