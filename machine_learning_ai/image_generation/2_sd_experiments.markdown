# Stable Diffusion Experiments - Riding a Tiger

Draw Things is an iOS app that generates Stable Diffusion images. The app's cover features an astronaut riding a horse on an alien planet.

With its inspiration, I tried using Stable Diffusion to generate an image of a person riding a tiger, but it proved to be much harder. Despite using various prompts, it took multiple attempts to produce something resembling what I wanted. I'm curious about why this was difficult. Images of a person riding a tiger are easily found through a simple Google search.

While this is worth some further pondering, here are some of my trials:


## The More Successful Ones

## The Less Successful Ones

Most of the time, the "man" or the "woman" is completely missing.

## Trials with Turtles

Not just tigers, I also tried with turtles and they were a little easier:
