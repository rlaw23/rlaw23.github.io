# Stable Diffusion - Scribble

Scribble is a ControlNet that can be used with Stable Diffusion. As its name implies, Scribble allows SD to take in the scribble of the user and generates images based off of that. After trying it out, I was amazed by how much the user can control SD with their own scribble.
