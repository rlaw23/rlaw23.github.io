# Better Approach to Work with ChatGPT

<br />

Here is an article by Ethan Mollick about his idea about the best approach to have AI generate essays: [My class required AI. Here's what I've learned so far.](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/my-class-required-ai-heres-what-ive). 

Ethan has multiple articles on how to work with AI to generate outputs that worth reading. I encourage you to take a look at them if you can.

In the above article, he thinks the best approach to have an AI to write an article is co-editing, where the user takes a recursive approach to provide **elaborate** and **specific** instructions (prompts) to the AI on how its previous response should be edited until the user is satisfied with the result. 

You can request it to include specific points, use a specific style and tone, address a specific audience, and start and end in a specific way.

Ethan found that this approach allows the user to have more control over the output than another approach that the user gives a full length prompt to the AI in each prompt.

Another important idea that Ethan gives but people so often miss is that, we are to write a prompt to achieve results, not to have a conversation with the AI. So what you need is to give clear and sufficient instructions (prompts) and refine the outputs as you move forward. There is no point in getting into a conversation.
