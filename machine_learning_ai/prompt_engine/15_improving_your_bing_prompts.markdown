# Improving Your Bing Prompt

<br />

The new Bing is now fully open to public. The major difference of Bing AI and GPT-4 is the ability to connect to the Internet. And that makes a whole world of difference.

Here is an article by Ethan Mollick about his tricks to improving his Bing AI prompts: [Power and Weirdness: How to Use Bing AI](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/power-and-weirdness-how-to-use-bing). I strongly encourage you to check out his article to see the examples of how he used Bing. 

Still here are his two main points:

1). Always ask Bing to look things up in the prompt, e.g. instead of "Do xxxx", prompt with "Look up xxxx, and use what you learn to do xxxx"

This is interesting. In my previous experience with Bing, I also found it provide responses similar to ChatGPT / GPT-4. It didn't occur to me that I could be better off to ask it to search the Internet outright.


2). Not only ask Bing to search, but we can also ask it to put together tables, write analysis, and do comparisons.

This is inspiring. The main idea is you outline the steps to approach a problem, then it will do it for you in no time. Bing is like an assistant or an intelligent college grad. It can do things neatly as long as you give it sufficient instructions. Do still be aware of hallucinations though.
