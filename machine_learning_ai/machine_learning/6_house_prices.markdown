# Predicting House Prices

<br />

This notebook is my attempt on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". I have attempted various methods on regression models, variable transformation, feature selections, and data visualization.

When I wrote this notebook, I did not mean to publish it on Kaggle so it was not as neat looking and well commented. Still hope it would give a glimpse into my data processing and coding capabilities.
