# Machine Learning and AI

I have been passionate about and followed the data science / machine learning / AI space for years. Here showcases some of my machine learning projects on Kaggle and some other thoughts on these topics.

I code in Python and am proficient in the pandas and scikit learn packages.

On the data visualization front, I am able to work with Tableau and Power BI.
