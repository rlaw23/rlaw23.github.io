Here is the link to my [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rowanlaw/nlp-disaster-tweets-hugging-face) on Kaggle.

This is a Kaggle competition on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Participants are provided with thousands of real historical tweets as training set to train their NLP models. And then they would use their models to predict which tweets in the test set are about real disasters.

I have used the DistilBERT model through Hugging Face and scored 0.81887 out of the full score of 1.
