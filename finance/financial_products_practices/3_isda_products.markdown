## ISDA OTC Derivatives Taxonomy

Although OTC derivatives have more or less commonly understood product names, they are not 100% standardized. 

In an effort to standardize this, primarily for the reason of cross-jurisdictional reporting, ISDA has published their taxonomy for OTC derivatives. That is the basis of asset class that you can see in HKTR and MAS reporting.

The taxonomy has 5 asset classes:

1. Commodities
2. Credit
3. Equities
4. FX
5. Rates


For example, a JPY interest rate swap would fall into:

| Asset Class    | Base Product   | Sub-Product   |
|:---------------|:---------------|:--------------|
| Interest Rate  | IR Swap        | Fixed Float   |



## Taxonomy Versions

There are two versions, namely [Taxonomy v1.0](/assets/others/ISDA-OTC-Derivatives-Taxonomy_v1.0_Reporting_14-Feb-2018_FINAL.xls) and [Taxonomy v2.0](/assets/others/ISDA-Taxonomy_EQ-CR-FX-IR_v2.0__3-_September_2019-FINAL.xls).

The two versions mean to [exist in parallel](https://www.isda.org/2019/07/24/isda-taxonomy-v1-0/). Institutions can still choose to use v1.0 for regulatory reporting. And they should use v2.0 when requesting for an ISIN for MiFID II.

Note that v2.0 doesn't have the Commodity asset class while v1.0 does.
