## BIC Code

<br />

A BIC code is a 8-character code that identifies a bank (or an institution) at a specific location. They are used to identify the banks that you are sending money to through SWIFT messages.

e.g. BIC code of Bank of New York = IRVTUS3N

- IRVT = institution / bank code
- US = country code
- 3N = location code

<br />

Sometimes you will see 11 characters instead of 8. Then the last three is the branch code. If it is XXX, then it's the primary office.

e.g. 

- Bank of New York (Fedwire): IRVTUS3N**XXX**
- Bank of New York (DTC):  IRVTUS3N**BIK**
