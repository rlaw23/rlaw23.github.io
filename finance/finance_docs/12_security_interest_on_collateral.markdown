<br />

Security Interest is one of the major differences of an English Law CSA and a New York Law CSA.

<br />

**Security interest** : legal entitlement given by a debtor (borrower) to a creditor (lender) for the debtor's collateral, allowing the creditor to access the property if the debtor fails to fulfill their secured obligations.


**Security agreement** : gives a lender a security interest in pledged collateral
