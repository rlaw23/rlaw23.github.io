## Introduction

The Monetary Authority of Singapore also has its own OTC derivatives reporting. MAS reporting is done through DTCC's GTR (Global Trade Repository) platform. MAS reporting often follows the practices of Australia's ASIC reporting.



## What to Report

If a financial institution is in-scope, then it needs to report:

1. its new in-scope transactions daily, by asset classes (i.e. interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, credit and commodities - in line with the ISDA product taxonomy)

2. the daily valuations of each of its reported transactions, also by asset classes



## Reporting Timeframe

Financial institutions need to report its new trades and valuations in 2 days.



## Backloading

Unlike HKTR, there is no backloading for MAS reporting. If a trade is reported beyond the T+2 timeframe, it is still uploaded to DTCC's GTR like a normal new trade.


## "Trade In" and "Book In"

"Trade In": means the trade is executed by an execution agent (traders) in the jurisdiction, i.e. execution agent located in SG.

"Book In": means the trade is booked to a trading party in Singapore, i.e. the fund is domiciled in SG.

Trades traded by an HKTR in-scope entity or booked to an HKTR in-scope entity are consequently in-scope of MAS reporting.


## Reporting Platforms

DTCC GTR is the designated platform for MAS reporting. Institutions can also use DTCC's report hub, Bloomberg or S&P to facilitate their reporting.


## Reporting Party

In most cases, trade repository reporting is handled by the investment manager on behalf of the fund itself.


## In-scope Products

Only OTC derivatives need to be reported to the MAS, common products are swaps, FX forwards, bond forwards, OTC options, CDS, etc are in scope.

Listed futures and repos are not in scope.
